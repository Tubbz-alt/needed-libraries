# needed-libraries for Nim

This repository contains a list of libraries that are missing in Nim's package ecosystem.

## How to use

If you want to use a library / tool / technology in Nim, please open an issue in this repo.

It would be especially helpful if you

* describe how do you expect the library to work
* give examples of similar functionality (or similar libraries in other languages)
* start developing or porting such a library yourself!

Please first check [the Nim list of libraries](https://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html)


If you want to contribute to Nim and open source, that's an excellent opportunity!

Find something that you're willing to work on and you can be assigned on the issue.
You can always ask for more help in the [chat](https://gitter.im/nim-lang/nim/) (you can use gitter, IRC, matrix), our [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/nim/) or the [forum](https://forum.nim-lang.org/)

You can also start maintaining an existing library if it's abandoned, if you reach agreement with its owner.

Feel free to use the github filters and search to find issues more quickly.

## Community survey

A base for this repo is the [2017 survey](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2017/10/01/community-survey-results-2017.html#what-critical-libraries-are-missing-in-the-nim-ecosystem)

It's a good read, and the other sections also help with insight in what's missing in Nim ecosystem.

## Other resources

If you want to find more about Nim, some good resources are:

* [Nim documentation](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html)
* [Nim in Action](https://book.picheta.me/): a book for Nim

You can always ask for help on the community channels, too.
